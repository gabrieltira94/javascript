# clean-code
Just a small repository with the purpose of exploring some JavaScript principles using simple real-world examples.

## Pre-requisites
There is only one requirement:
- Have *npm* installed ([official documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-installer-to-install-nodejs-and-npm));

## Repository structure
Directories:
  - Each directory represents a topic with an example;
  - They are independent one to another;
  - Each directory has a standard executable file *main.js*.

Playground:
  - Open a terminal in one of the desired directory and run:
  > $ node main.js
